Surgeries are divided into three categories: Easy(requires Prosthetics research), Hard(requires Bionics research), and Very Hard(requires MSE_ArchotechSurgery research). The exact material requirements for every surgery can be found by clicking the info button (i) on the surgery's bill, or you may read further for a list of all the surgeries and their requirements. Be aware that each category of surgery comes with a different chance of death upon failure (1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively).

### Exact Changelog

__Easy surgeries:__  
Research required: Prosthetics  
After research, an easy surgery will take 2,000 work and require a doctor with level 8 Medicine.  

These surgeries allow for the instant healing of any of the following injuries: Burn, Crush, Crack, Cut, Surgical cut, Scratch, Bite, Stab, Gunshot, Shredded, Bruise and/or Frostbite, but, at the cost of 3 units of either regular or glitterworld medicine and 3 units of synthread, you might want to save them to cure any residual scarring instead.[spoiler](from what I can tell, the game treats a scar the same as the original wound; I have not been able to find a way to create a treatment for only a scar)[/spoiler] Surgeries to replace missing noses also fall under this category, requiring 3 units of either regular or glitterworld medicine and 3 units of synthread.

__Hard surgeries:__  
Research required: Bionics  
After research, a hard surgery will take 4500 work and require a doctor with level 15 Medicine.
